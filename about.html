            <p class="TLP">After opening its glorious doors in December of 2009, the Grill Em All Truck blazed a
                gastronomic path through southern California with its over the top gourmet burgers and
                general food truck tom foolery. After standing triumphant at the end of the Food Networks
                very first Great Food Truck Race and being featured on the Best Thing I Ever Ate, the
                demand for burgers grew strong enough that even two trucks were not enough and the
                decision was made to open a brick and mortar. The trucks, lovingly dubbed the Beast and
                Son of Beast, were both laid to rest in a glorious viking funeral.</p>

        <h3>Where we're at now</h3>

            <p class="TLP">The doors to Grill Em Alls version of Valhalla opened in January of 2013;
                featuring a new and expanded menu, nine craft beers on tap and a revolving line
                up of special menu items. It's a heavy metal club house made for Grill Em All
                Ghouls to be able to smash great food, drinks and enjoy themselves seven days a week.
                Since opening huge rock and roll icons have stopped in from Dee Snider to Zakk Wylde and
                Valhalla has played host to record release parties, in store jam sessions
                and live podcasts!</p>
